This is a mobile app, you can use expo to run it on android or on ios. This application gives you an address, building, and campus, based on a University of Michigan Classroom code. It consumes the University of Michigan classroom and spaces API in order to do so. It is made in React.tsx. In order to use this you need to obtain your own University of Michigan api key and client key, PLEASE do not set these in the file, rather put them in your environment
